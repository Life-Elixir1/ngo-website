        <h2>Education Support</h2><br>
        <p>
          One of our core activities is paying school fees for primary and secondary education. We believe that education
          is a powerful tool for empowerment and strive to ensure that underprivileged children have access to quality
          education.
        </p>
        <p>
          We consider several factors when selecting candidates for educational support, including financial need, academic
          potential, and commitment to education. By offering scholarships to Nigerian institutions, we aim to empower
          deserving individuals to pursue their educational aspirations and unlock their full potential. Our team
          diligently performs background investigation on the eligibility of all sponsored candidates. School fees will be
          paid directly to the educational institution from the organization's account.

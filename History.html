  		<p> Life-Elixir Care Foundation was incorporated in July 2023 and officially commenced major activities in August 2023. Our vision was inspired by witnessing numerous children deprived of basic education due to financial constraints. Additionally, we observed the high unemployment rates among enthusiastic youths with viable business ideas, hindered by a lack of financial resources. We then sought to meet the needs of the young, without neglecting the old who receive less attention in our society.
		</p>
		<p> We recognized the importance of keeping young people engaged through skill acquisition training, enlightenment programs, and awareness initiatives to guide them towards success and away from social vices. Furthermore, our organization was driven by the realization of the poor care given to older individuals, leading to high mortality rates, which motivated the establishment of our caring for the elderly division.
		</p>
		<p> By providing support, education, and opportunities, Life-Elixir Care Foundation strives to create a brighter future for the less privileged, empowering them to break free from the cycle of poverty and lead fulfilling lives while also providing adequate care for the old during their needy age.
		</p>

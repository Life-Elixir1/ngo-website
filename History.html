    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Life-Elixir Care Foundation was incorporated in July 2023 and officially commenced major activities in August
      2023. Our vision was inspired by witnessing numerous children deprived of basic education due to financial
      constraints. Additionally, we observed the high unemployment rates among enthusiastic youths with viable business
      ideas, hindered by a lack of financial resources. We then sought to meet the needs of the young, without neglecting
      the elderly who receive less attention in our society.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recognized the importance of keeping young people engaged through skill acquisition training, enlightenment
      programs, and awareness initiatives to guide them towards success and away from social vices. Furthermore, our
      organization was driven by the realization of the poor care given to older individuals, leading to high mortality
      rates, which motivated the establishment of our caring for the elderly division.
    </p>
    <p>
      By providing support, education, and opportunities, Life-Elixir Care Foundation strives to create a brighter future
      for the less privileged, empowering them to contribute positively to their communities and society at large.
